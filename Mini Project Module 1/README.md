# Speedball
 
As a supplemental project you can work on creating levels 1 and 2 for the Speedball game. 

Game Objective:
Dodge all obstacles in the player’s path to reach the finish line at the end of the path. 

How to Play:
Left click on the mouse to move the ball left and right. 

What to do:
Level 1 has already been created for you to play and use as reference. You are responsible for putting up walls in the path for levels 1 and 2. You can accomplish this by creating 3D objects and placing them on the path with different transform property values. Make sure to add a “wall” tag to each of your objects that you place on the path so the player dies when it collides with these objects. Get creative! You can use any 3D objects you would like!

Where to find levels 1 and 2:
Navigate to the scenes folder and work on each scene accordingly.
